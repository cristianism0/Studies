# Abstract State Machines

A C program can be seen as sort of a machine that manipulates values: 
the particular values that variables of the program have at a given time and intermediate values that are the results of computed expressions.

ex: 
```c
double x = 5;
double y = 3;

x = (x * 1.5) - y;

printf("value ox x is: %g\n", 4.5);
```

The subexpressions: definition and initialization of x and y are not observable by our program.

We do not called any of the variable on printf,so, our compiler will replace the printf with 4.5 in %g because 4.5 is a fixed value.
We call this **optimization**.

For a optimization to be valid, the C compiler must produces an executable that reproduces the *observable states*.
Observable states consist of the contents of some variables and the output as they envolved during the execution of the program.

To explaint the abstract state machine we have to look into concepts of a value, the type and the representation.
