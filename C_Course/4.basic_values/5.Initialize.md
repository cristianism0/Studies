# Initilize

ALL THE VARIABLES MUST BE INITIALIZED.

Initializers help us guarantee that a program execution is always in a defined state so that whenever we acces an object, it has a well-known value
that determines the state of the abstract machine.

The exception for initialize all variables if for highly optimized programs. 

For example, in arrays:

```c
double A[] = {7.3, };
```

If there's no length definition, the array is said to have an `incomplete type`. In the array, each initializer is defined in its position
on the array.

If you don't know how to initialize a var, you can use the **default initializer** `T`:

```c
T a = {};
```

Also, using '{ }' is a valid initializer for all objects.
