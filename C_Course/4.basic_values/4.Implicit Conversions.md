# Implicity Conversions

As we saw before, the type of a operand has a influence on the operator expression, ex -1 and -1U, where -1 is a `signed` value
and -1U is a `unsigned` value. Since unsigned values cant be negative, -1U is a LARGE positive integer.

> Unary - and + have the type of their promoted operand.

Near the type size, some narrow conversions can be dangerous, specially using - or + into signed or unsigned values.

> Avoid using narrow conversions.

> Don't use narrow types under arithmetics.

```c
1 + 0.0             // Harmless; double
1+ I                // Harmless; complex float
INT_MAX + 0.0F      // May lose precision; float
INT_MAX + I         // May lose precision; complex float
INT_MAX + 0.0       // Usually harmless; double
```

The first two are harmless, they fits well on double and complex types. Look at the result:
when we use mixed types, the type of the result will be the wider to avoid data loss.

Since double is wider than float, usually INT_MAX will not fit on float and can cause data loss.

For security reasons:

> Avoid operations with operators of different signedness.

> Use unsigned values whenever you can.

> Chose your arithmetics types such that implicit conversions are harmless.
