# Named constants

For example, in a code with a tedious repetition of a value we can name it as a const.

> All constants with a particular meaning must be named.

> All constants with different meanings must be distinguished.

Macros are used also as constants. 

We call const qualifier, objects that are **read-only.**

String literals are read-only, for a more formal struct, string literals should be `char const[]`
