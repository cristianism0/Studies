# Values


A value in C is a *abstract entity* that exists beyond your program, the particular implementation of that program
and the representation of the value durint the run of the program.  

For example: The value of 0 should and always will always have the same effects on all C platforms:
- Any value x + 0 will be x;
- Using 0 in a control expression will trigger boolean *false*;

This also is a concept of C:
> All values are numbers or translated to numbers.

By far, a executable with the same data produced by a C program will output the same value.

But, C are used to different platforms and we need to go beyond. For this portability we need to know **types**.
