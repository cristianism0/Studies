# Operands and Operators

The main type we will learn about is the *size_t*, which we have already met.

Such values correspond to "sizes", so it cannot be under 0. So its represents all the numbers in these sets:
$\mathbb N$ and $\mathbb N_{0}$

Once computers are limited and $\mathbb N_{0}$ are not. We can use `SIZE_MAX` as a limit.

> __size_t__ represents values in the range of [0, SIZE_MAX]

Values assinged with size_t are called: *[]*


SIZE_MAX values depends on the plataform we are using. It can be:
-> 2^16 - 1
-> 2^32 - 1
-> 2^64 - 1


Usually, we don't need to specify the SIZE_MAX since <stdint.h> provides it to us.

For summary, size_t:

- cannot be negative
- represents a count, index or a mem allocation.
- memory related operations.

__size_t__ is adaptative to 32 bits and 64 bits.
If they are be executed on a 32 bits computer, their size will be 4 bits. If not, will be 8.
