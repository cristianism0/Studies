# Evaluation Order

Ther order of evaluation is also called *priority*.

> Logical operations: `&&, ||, ?, :, and (**,**) evaluate their first operand first.`
```c
size_t size_min(size_t a, size_t b){
    return (a < b) ? a : b.
}

size_t a = 0;
size_t b = 0;


if(a == 0 || b == "whatever"){
        // this will be executed because the first operations is TRUE
    } 
```

The comma (,) will give a order to evaluate (f(a), f(b)) will evaluate f(a) first.

> TIP: **DO NOT** use the comma operator. It can be confusing for readability.
