# Boolean Values 

Some operators yield a value of 0 or 1. They can be grouped into two categories:
- comparisons
- logicals

## Comparions Evaluations

We already saw the comparison operators: 
- `==, !=, <, >`, those 2 lasts are **strict** comparators, we can combine them with `=`.

- `<=` is *less than or equals to*
- `>=` is *bigger than or equals to*

Comparison values returns **true** or **false**;
*fancy names for 1 and 0.*

## Logic Operators

They are used on values that already has a value of True or False, if they are not, remember that 0 is false.

- `!` is a negative operator 
- `&&` is a logical *and*
- `||` is a logical *or*

They will always returns a boolean value: True or False.

> TIP: We can force a boolean value using `!!` in front of a scalar value.
