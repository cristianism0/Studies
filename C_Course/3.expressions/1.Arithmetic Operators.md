# Arithmetic

-> `+, -, *, /` are used to do: sum, difference, product and division between values.

```c
size_t a = 45;
size_t b = 7;
size_t c = (a - b) * 2;
size_t d = a - b*2;
```

if the results still insided of __size_t__ range, then it will be size_t too.

If the result its not representable in __size_t__ we will get a **overflow**. 

For instance, if we multiply values that are higher than 2^64-1, than we will have a overflow.

## / and % operators

They are used for integer division and remainder operation.

e.g:
```c
size_of a = 10;
size_of b = 3;
double c = a/b; //>>3.33333
size_of d = a%b; //>> 1
```
    
d is 1 because the remain of 10/3 is 1.

So if we have a divion like: z = a/b. The remain of a/b can be given by: a - z*b;

Then, its like:

```c
a == (a/b)*b + (a%b)
```

> If the second operator is 0, both divisions are not allowed.
