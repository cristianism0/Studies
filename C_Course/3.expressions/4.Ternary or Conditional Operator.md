# Ternary

Ternary operator is like a `if` statement. But returns the value of a chosen branch.

```c
size_t size_min(size_t a, size_t b) {
    return (a < b) ? a : b;
}
```
This means: (a is less than b)? if yes: return the bool value of a, if not, the bool value of b.

Ternary operations are not used too much in software delepment because the readability is sometimes overwhelming.
